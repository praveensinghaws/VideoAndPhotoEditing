Thank you for downloading our official Rec709 normalization LUT pack. This readme will outline which version of our LUTs you should be using.

From time to time we will make improvements to our Flat/HLG/Log gamma curves, and this may result in an update to the LUTs.

Which LUT should I use?

LEGACY VERSION: For FiLMiC Pro 6.16.1 and older on iOS, please use FiLMiC_deLog_V2_legacy.cube and FiLMiC_deFlat_V2_legacy.cube files.

For FiLMiC Pro 6.16.2 and later on iOS and Android, please use FiLMiC_deLog_V2b.cube and FiLMiC_deFlat_V2b.cube for your 8bit Flat and Log V2 recordings.

For 10bit HLG and LogV3 capture on iOS, please use FiLMiC_deLog_V3.cube and FiLMiC_deHLG_v3.cube files.

For ProRes Flat v3+ and ProRes Log V3+ please use FiLMiC_deFlatPlus_Neutral.cube FiLMiC_deLogV3Plus_Neutral.cube. In addition we provide two additional creative LUTs for LogV3+ â€” FiLMiC_deLogV3Plus_Muted.cube FiLMiC_deLogV3Plus_Vibrant.cube.
